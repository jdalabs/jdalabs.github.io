&lt;p&gt;This project was derived from a real-life loading problem arising at one of the leading tire manufacturer. Because there exists a wide range of agricultural tires, each shipment is unique and container loading plans have to be determined on a per case basis. From a theoretical perspective, dealing with circular shapes differs significantly from classical rectangular box packing problems. The team studied several solution approaches and eventually proposed an innovative and efficient method. They highlighted the parameters that were key to the success of this method. Insights gain from this research study have been used in TMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each year the Canadian Operational Research Society conducts a competition on the practice of operational research to recognize the challenging application of the OR approach to the solution of applied problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, this prize was awarded to a team with Philippe Grangier, Marc Brisson, Louis-Martin Rousseau (JDA Labs) and John Ye (TMS Team) together with Michel Gendreau (Ecole Polytechnique de Montréal, Canada) and Fabien Lehuédé (IMT Atlantique, France). The team received this award at the 21st Conference of the International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS) held in Quebec City in July 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mixed Reality Visualization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the research code has been integrated in another JDA Labs project that focuses on 3D vizualization of instruction-based tasks (featured in project video.) This proved to be useful in expanding the scope of the 3D instruction interface, &lt;a href=&quot;/project/20170731/instructar&quot;&gt;instructAR&lt;/a&gt;, which was originally designed for pallet building.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Winner of the 2017 Canadian Operational Research Society Practice Prize</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">instructAR</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/project/20170731/instructar" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="instructAR" /><published>2017-07-31T12:55:26-04:00</published><updated>2017-07-31T12:55:26-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/project/20170731/instructar</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/project/20170731/instructar">&lt;p&gt;InstructAR is a set of visualization tools to overlay information directly onto a real world workspace allowing us to guide workers through complex, sometimes non-intuitive tasks simply and accurately. We are currently experimenting with applications of this idea to pallet and truck loading since loading instructions can become complex and loading accuracy is important for optimized pallet builds and truck loading plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our pallet loading application we project the location of the next box to load directly onto the pallet itself using the Hololens mixed reality headset. The user advances through the steps by using air taps or voice command. For demo purposes the app has three pre-built pallet configurations but we imagine in the future that it could obtain pallet instructions from an optimizer running on a server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;/project/20170809/tire-loading&quot;&gt;Tire loading&lt;/a&gt; application has a similar interface but takes its loading plan from a real optimization algorithm created by the data science team at JDA Labs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also experimented with visualizing the instructions using spatial AR, i.e. by projecting the instructions onto a pallet using a digital projector. This has the advantage of not requiring a bulky headset but has other design considerations that need to be worked out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">InstructAR is a set of visualization tools to overlay information directly onto a real world workspace allowing us to guide workers through complex, sometimes non-intuitive tasks simply and accurately.
